        <p>The cherry blossom (桜, sakura) is Japan's unofficial national flower. It is regarded as a symbol of renewal,
            vitality, and beauty. It has been celebrated for many centuries and holds a very prominent position in
            Japanese culture. There are many dozens of different cherry tree varieties in Japan, most of which bloom for
            just a couple of days in spring. The seasonal spectacle is celebrated with Hanami (花見 - cherry blossom
            viewing) parties under the trees.</p>
        <img alt="sakura" class="img-fluid rounded" src="../images/cherry-blossom/sakura-1.jpg">
        <p>"Hanami" is the centuries-old practice of drinking under a blooming <i>sakura</i> or <i>ume</i> tree. The
            custom is said to have started during the Nara period (710–794), when it was <i>ume</i> blossoms that people
            admired in the beginning, but by the Heian period (794–1185) cherry blossoms came to attract more attention,
            and <i>hanami</i> was synonymous with <i>sakura</i>. From then on, in both waka and haiku, "flowers" (花 <i>hana</i>)
            meant "cherry blossoms". The custom was originally limited to the elite of the Imperial Court, but soon
            spread to samurai society and, by the Edo period, to the common people as well. Tokugawa Yoshimune planted
            areas of cherry blossom trees to encourage this. Under the <i>sakura</i> trees, people had lunch and drank
            sake in cheerful feasts.
        </p>
        <img alt="sakura" class="img-fluid rounded" src="../images/cherry-blossom/hanami-1.jpg"/>
        <p>Every year the Japanese Meteorological Agency and the public track the <i>sakura zensen</i> (cherry blossom
            front) as it moves northward up the archipelago with the approach of warmer weather via nightly forecasts
            following the weather segment of news programs. The blossoming begins inOkinawa in January, and typically
            reaches Kyoto and Tokyo at the end of March or the beginning of April. It proceeds into areas at the higher
            altitudes and northward, arriving in Hokkaido a few weeks later. Japanese pay close attention to these
            forecasts and turn out in large numbers at parks, shrines and temples with family and friends to hold
            flower-viewing parties. <i>Hanami</i> festivals celebrate the beauty of the cherry blossom and for many are
            a chance to relax and enjoy the beautiful view. The custom of <i>hanami</i> dates back many centuries in
            Japan. The eighth-century chronicle <i>Nihon Shoki</i> (日本書紀) records <i>hanami</i> festivals being held as
            early as the third century AD.
        </p>
        <p>Most Japanese schools and public buildings have cherry blossom trees outside of them. Since the fiscal and
            school year both begin in April, in many parts of Honshu, the first day of work or school coincides with the
            cherry blossom season.

        <p>The Japan Cherry Blossom Association developed a list of Japan's Top 100 Cherry Blossom Spots with at
            least one location in every prefecture. According that list, Yoshino is famous for the best cherry blossom
            in Japan. Yoshino features 30,000 cherry blossom trees which blossom over an extended period. Yoshino is
            located in Nara Prefecture. Yoshino, or more particularly Mt Yoshino, is famous for its cherry blossom and
            holds the unofficial claim to having the best Cherry Blossom in all of Japan. Mt Yoshino (Yoshinoyama) is
            also featured on the list of Japan's Top 100 Cherry Blossom Spots. It is not just the vast number of cherry
            blossom trees; 30,000, or the large variety; 200, that makes Mt Yoshino the best place in Japan to view
            cherry blossom, it is the extended period over which you view the blossom. The cherry blossom trees on Mt
            Yoshino are planted in four distinct areas, each progressively higher up the mountain. Shimo Senbon is the
            lower forest, Naka Senbon is the middle forest, Kami Senbon is the upper forest and Oku Senbon is the deep
            forest. The placement of the cherry blossom trees at different altitudes and positions leads to the blossom
            coming out at different stages, thus extending the total time there are at least some trees in blossom.
