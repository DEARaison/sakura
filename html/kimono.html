            <p>The Japanese <strong>kimono</strong> is one of the world's instantly recognizable traditional
                garments. The word kimono literally means "clothing", and up until the mid 19th century it was the
                form of dress worn by everyone in Japan. That began to change slowly with the import of suits
                dresses and other western fashions during the Meiji Era.</p>

            <p>Thanks to the popularity of ukiyo-e woodblock prints in the West at the beginning of the last
                century, the kimono-clad maiden became one of the quintessential images of Japan. Dressing up in the
                kimono and other accoutrements of the geisha or maiko is still one of the more popular activities
                for visiting
                tourists.</p>

            <p>There are different types of kimono for different occasions and seasons, including those worn by men.
                Other than those worn daily by some older people or performers of traditional arts, kimono are a
                much less common sight these days but are still widely worn on special occasions such as weddings
                and graduation ceremonies.
            </p>
            <p>Part of the reason is the cost, as a decent silk kimono will set you back the best part of a million
                yen. But there is also the question of how to put on the kimono and tie the obi (decorative sash), a
                complicated procedure that is beyond the ability of many young women. They usually have to ask their
                mothers to help them or take course at a kimono school.

            <h3>What is the history of Japanese kimono?</h3>
            <img alt="Couple in kimono" class="img-fluid rounded" src="../images/kimono/couple-in-kimono.jpg">
            <p>
                Though the kimono is a decidedly Japanese form of dress, it is said that its roots are from China. The
                earliest form of kimono were worn as a type of undergarment, gaining popularity in Japan during the
                Muromachi period (1392–1573), when they began to be worn without hakama (traditional Japanese trousers),
                and paired with a sash called an obi.
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn't until the Edo period (1603–1867) that the kimono as we know it today really came into its own,
                with an ever-expanding variety of colors, fabrics, and styles available. The obi became wider, and the
                length of the kimono sleeves grew as well. Kimono are typically only worn by women or girls, however,
                there are some exceptions.

                <p>There are several elements involved when wearing a kimono. To understand a kimono, it’s important to
                    know
                    the pieces involved. The following are some of the main parts involved in wearing a kimono.<br>
                    <br>
                    ・Kimono - This is the main garment, which can be made from a variety of materials including, cotton,
                    linen, wool, and silk. <br>
                    <br>
                    ・Obi - The outermost sash that is tied around a kimono. The knot can be tied in a variety of
                    decorative
                    ways.<br>

                    ・Tabi - Socks made specifically to be worn with traditional Japanese footwear. The toe area is split
