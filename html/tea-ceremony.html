            <p>The Japanese tea ceremony (茶道, sadō or chadō, lit. "the way of tea" or 茶の湯, chanoyu) is a Japanese
                tradition steeped in history. It is a ceremonial way of preparing and drinking <a
                        href="cuisine/tea.html">green
                    tea</a> typically in a traditional tearoom with <a href="others/japanese-style-rooms.html">tatami
                    floor</a>.
                Beyond
                just serving and receiving tea, one of the main purposes of the tea ceremony is for the guests to enjoy
                the hospitality of the host in an atmosphere distinct from the fast pace of everyday life.</p>

            <h3>Historic background</h3>
            <p>
                Tea was introduced to Japan in the 8th century from China and was drunk as a medicinal beverage mainly
                amongst priests and the upper class. It was not until the Muromachi Period (1333-1573) that the beverage
                gained popularity among people of all social classes. Among the affluent members of society, tea
                drinking parties became popular in which participants would show off their exquisite tea bowls and
                display their knowledge about tea.
            </p>
            <p>
                Around the same time, a more refined version of tea parties developed with Zen-inspired simplicity and a
                greater emphasis on spirituality. It is from these gatherings that the tea ceremony has its origins. The
                father of the modern way of tea was Sen no Rikyu (1522-1591) who advocated an austere, rustic
                simplicity. Most of today's schools of tea ceremony, including Omotesenke and Urasenke, developed from
                his teachings.

            <h3>Tea ceremony procedure</h3>
            <p>
                A full, formal tea ceremony is a multi-hour event that starts with a kaiseki course meal, is followed by
                a bowl of thick tea and ends with a bowl of thin tea. However, most tea ceremonies these days are much
                abbreviated events that are limited to the enjoyment of a bowl of thin tea.
            </p>
            <p>
                The protocol of a tea ceremony is defined down to exact hand movements which vary slightly between the
                different schools. In most cases, regular tourists are not expected to know the rules in detail, but a
                knowledge of the basic points below can help make the event a more dignified affair.

                <h5>1) Dress code</h5>
                <p>Avoid gaudy fashion and fragrance that distracts from the tea experience. Wear modest clothes, remove
                    jewelry that may damage the tea equipment and avoid strong perfumes.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h5>2) Garden</h5>
                <p>The traditional tea ceremony venue is surrounded by a garden, although many modern venues lack a
                    garden. The garden is deliberately kept tranquil and simple to encourage a calm spirit. Flowers with
                    gaudy colors or deep scents are avoided as they are a distraction. Stones of varying shapes and
                    sizes make up the path that leads to the teahouse. A stone lantern is placed close to a stone basin
                    near the entrance where visitors wash their hands before entering the tearoom.</p>

            <article>
                <h5>3) Tearoom</h5>
                <p>The ceremony is traditionally held in a tatami room. The entrance for guests is sometimes kept low so
                    that entering guests have to bend over, symbolizing humility. Decorative elements in the tearoom,
                    include an alcove (tokonoma) where a scroll or seasonal flowers are displayed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a bow, the head guest enters the room and takes the seat closest to the alcove, followed by
                    the other guests. Guests ideally sit in a seiza position on the tatami floor. Once guests have taken
                    their positions, it is customary to bow once more before observing the decorations which were
                    carefully selected for the occasion.</p>

            <article>
                <h5>4) Preparing the tea</h5>
                <p>The host typically prepares the tea in front of the guests. The main equipment includes the tea
                    whisk (chasen), tea container for the powdered green tea (natsume), tea scoop (chashaku), tea
                    bowl, sweets container or plate, and the kettle and brazier. Each piece of equipment was
                    carefully selected according to circumstance and has its specific place.</p>

            <article>
                <h5>5) Enjoying the tea and bowl</h5>
                <p>A <a href="cuisine/sweet-food.html">Japanese sweet</a> is served before tea and is supposed to be
                    eaten
                    before
                    the tea is drunk. The tea bowl is placed onto the tatami mat in front of you, with its front
                    facing you. Pick it up with your right hand and place it on your left palm. With your right
                    hand, turn it clockwise by around 90 degrees so that its front is not facing you anymore. Drink
                    the tea in a few sips and place it back onto the tatami. Bow and express gratitude after
                    receiving and finishing your tea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Towards the end of the ceremony, there will be time to inspect and appreciate the tea bowl by
                    lifting it. Once finished, turn the bowl so that the front now faces the host. The host may ask if
                    guests would like another round of tea, and if not, the tea ceremony is over when the host washes
                    the tea utensils and returns the equipment to where they were before starting.</p>
